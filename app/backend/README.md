# Backend Application

This is the backend part of our application. It provides the following functionality:

- API endpoints for data retrieval and manipulation
- Database connection and management

## Requirements

The application requires the following packages:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

## Installation

To install and run the backend application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure the environment variables:

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend application and add the following variables:

    ```plaintext
    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
    ```

    Replace `your-database` with the name of your MongoDB database.

4. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The backend application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

The backend application exposes the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/users`: Get all users
- `GET /api/users/:id`: Get a specific user by ID
- `POST /api/users`: Create a new user
- `PUT /api/users/:id`: Update a user by ID
- `DELETE /api/users/:id`: Delete a user by ID

You can use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with these endpoints.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the backend API:

- Get all users:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/users
  ```

- Get a specific user by ID:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/users/1
  ```

- Create a new user:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}' http://localhost:3000/api/users
  ```

- Update a user by ID:

  ```bash
  curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Jane Doe"}' http://localhost:3000/api/users/1
  ```

- Delete a user by ID:

  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/users/1
  ```

Feel free to customize the documentation based on your specific backend application and API endpoints.
